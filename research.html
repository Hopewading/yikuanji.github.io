            <div class="project-title">Distributional Impacts of Congestion Charge Policy in New York City</div>
            <div class="project-type">Job Market Paper</div>
            <div class="project-description">
              Abstract: Traffic congestion imposes large costs on U.S. cities, yet congestion pricing has rarely been adopted. In January 2025, New York City became the first to implement a cordon-based congestion charge for vehicles entering Manhattan’s Central Business District. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of its distributional impacts. Using the New York City Citywide Mobility Survey with traffic data from Google Maps and INRIX, I estimate a discrete choice model of mode choice extended with a congestion feedback mechanism linking travel demand to road speeds. Counterfactual simulations evaluate both the toll’s direct effects and alternative revenue allocation strategies. The results show that the charge reduces driving and shifts trips toward transit. Higher income households tend to absorb the toll, while lower-income households adjust more through mode shifts. Revenue use is decisive: transit investment and fare subsidies mitigate regressivity and can yield progressive outcomes. These findings highlight that equity depends not only on pricing but also on how revenues are spent.

            <div class="project-title">The Effect of Marginal Change in Public Transit System on Traffic Congestion</div>
            <div class="project-type">Working Paper</div>
            <div class="project-description">
                 Abstract: The impact of public transit on relieving traffic congestion remains a topic of debate. This paper uses a panel event study and a difference-in-differences (DID) design to estimate the impact of an intensive marginal change in the public transit system on traffic congestion, using data from three new subway stations in New York City (NYC) that opened in 2017. The results show that on average, traffic delays in nearby road sections decreased by 12.0% to 15.0% after the opening of the new stations, a magnitude similar to the effects reported in the literature for the entire transit system. The study also calculates an annual direct congestion-relief benefit of the transit system, estimated to be $332,601. These findings provide evidence for the potential of marginal changes in the public transit system to relieve traffic congestion and support the importance of subsidizing public transit.

               Abstract: Road Construction, proposed as a solution to severe congestion, might increase commuting time and decrease traffic speed due to poor management or delay in completion. This project combined the INRIX traffic data with 13,000 construction record data to estimate the network effect of road construction on traffic speed in the Manhattan area of New York City, calculate the exact amount of congestion cost caused by construction and evaluate the efficiency of penalty on late completion and feasibility of bonus for early completion in the construction contrast. The main finding is that an extra road construction project will decrease traffic speed by 1.0%-1.6%, causing commuting time to increase by 0.06%-0.09%. Regarding the distance to the construction, traffic speed will decrease by 1.6% when the average distance to the construction sites increases by 1%. The estimated cost of a decrease in speed of an extra road project is about $33,000- 104,000 per day for Manhattan commuters, which is relatively higher than the late penalty in construction contrast. This project suggests that a bonus for early completion or a higher penalty for late completion should be considered in road construction contrast.

            <div class="project-description">
                Abstract: Road Construction, which is proposed as a solution to severe congestion, might increase commuting time and decrease traffic speed due to poor management or delay in completion. This paper sets up a traffic dataset with 2 million real-time traffic speed data and 13,000 construction record data from 2017 - 2019 to estimate the marginal effect of road construction on traffic speed in New York City and evaluate the efficiency of construction contrast. The main finding is that traffic speed will decrease by 3.47% on average when vehicles are 1km closer to the road project. Speed decreases slower when vehicles are further from construction. Besides, long-duration and "unplanned" projects have a greater effect on vehicle speed. The estimated cost of a decrease in speed is about $326-451 per hour, which is relatively higher than the penalty in construction contrast. Based on this, this paper suggests that a bonus for early completion or a higher penalty for late completion should be considered in road construction contrast.
